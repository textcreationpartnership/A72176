            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any in theſe dayes, with great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, haue encountred the Papiſts, &amp; ſtrongly confuted their errours: It may be maruelled therefore, what ſhould make me ſo bold as to attempt any ſuch matter, after ſo great clearkes, being farre vnable to come nigh that which they haue attayned. I anſwere in mine owne defence, that my trauell is not to this ende, as though I would make pretence of equall learning with thoſe: but rather to put the ſtone and ſling into the hands of litle Dauid, to conquer great Goliah withall, when as he is not able to weld the weighty armour of Saul. The battell is hot &amp; fierce euery where, betweene Iſraell &amp; the vncircumciſed Philiſtines. Great armor &amp; weapons are prepared for the ſouldiers wherewith to arme and defend themſelues: yet for the moſt part, not ſuch as do fit young Dauid. For whereas ſundry men of fame haue ſhewed deepe skill, in ſetting foorth their bookes to confute the Papiſts, full of learning out of the ancient Doctors, Councels, Hyſtoriographers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: it doth not ſo well ſerue the turne of the ſimple vnlearned man, neither can he defend himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, becauſe it is beyond his reach. This is the thing which hath moued me to write ſomewhat of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:173409:3"/> matters: applying my ſelfe to the capacitie of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, dealing onely out of the word of God, which lyeth open vnto them as their Armorie. This alſo hath cauſed me to deale in thoſe points which do moſt commonly trouble them, omitting the great points in controuerſie: perſwaded that I performe a duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For like as when an houſe is on fire, the weake which is not able to throw a bucket of water to the top of the roofe, may yet by no meanes be excuſed, if he ſtand and looke on: becauſe he may do ſomewhat in the lower parts of the walles: Euen ſo I thinke my ſelfe not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, for this, that I am not of ability for to ſet foorth any thing, which may reach ſo high as to encounter with the principall aduerſaries, and to further the learned: ſeeing I may profit the ſimpler ſort, for whoſe ſakes, and in reſpect of whom, I haue taken this trauel. I preſent this ſimple and poore treatiſe vnto your honor, not as though I did eſteeme it worthy to beare the name and title of ſo noble, ſo honorable, and ſo great a perſonage, and of ſo high eſtate. But onely (hauing no other way or meane) to ſignifie and ſhew forth a thankfull mind, for that great ayde and honourable aſſiſtance which I haue receiued from your Lordſhip, in the furtherance and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Goſpell. It hath pleaſed the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Lord of the whole earth, to appoint me being very weake to build in the deſolate places, and to ſpreade the light of his glorious Goſpell, euen there, where it appeareth by the abundance of iniquity that of long time Satan hath had his throne. How vnwilling he is to be diſplaced, and to giue ouer the roome vnto Chriſt, may euidently appeare, euen by this, that he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp his warriers, which like wild Bores would roote vp all that may be planted, which with malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſubtill craft, conſpire what miſchiefe ſoeuer they can, thruſting forth their bold inſtrument, which with an iron face, is ſo hardy that he dare attempt any thing; which could no way be danted in his venturous
<pb facs="tcp:173409:3"/> attempts, nor their furie qualified, vntill ſuch time as he was fallen into the hands of your honour, to come to his account for his manifold miſdemeanours, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome wages for his trauell. I truſt therefore your honour will thinke the beſt of this my boldneſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it is what I am able. If I could in more ample manner teſtifie my good will, &amp; in any ſort to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, agreeable vnto that which of duty I owe for your great kindneſſe, then would I be glad. But I leaue the full recompence vnto him who is able indeede to reward whatſoeuer is done for his name ſake, &amp; for the defence of his Goſpell, and ſuccour of his litle flocke, which is alwayes compaſſed about with ſo many enemies, that they are able to deuour and eat it vp, and yet their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies no whit the fuller. Some do wonder how it ſhould come to paſſe, that among vs there ſhould be ſo many, which being borne ſince the Goſpell was reſtored in this land, are ſo zealouſly addicted vnto Popery, which they neuer did know: and ſo vtter enemies vnto the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which they heare: but if they weigh the cauſes of this deadly miſchiefe, they will ceaſe wondring at that, and rather wonder, that there be no more. For how can it be, ſo long as there be ſo many abuſes in the miniſtery, but that many ſhal ſtumble and loth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: for from thence, as it is manifeſt, the chiefe cauſe of this euill doth ſpring. True it is, that our miniſtery, doth fight againſt them, but yet in ſuch ſort, that it doth greatly increaſe them, ſeeming and pretending to tread vpon thoſe cockatrice egges, for to breake them, and ſo to deſtroy vtterly the viperous generation, when as indeed, they ſit vpon them, and ſo hatch the broodes of this euill kind, and bring them forth in great plentie. For behold a number cry out againſt Popery, and proclaime vtter defiance in ſpeech, but their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſuch, that for euery one which they conuert to the Goſpell, they cauſe an hundred to reuolt, to be hardned in their errours, or fall into flat Atheiſme:
<pb facs="tcp:173409:4"/> while many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the profeſſion which they made when they entred, ſetting aſide the care of ſoules, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming, nor regarding what become of them, ſtudie moſt how to clime high, &amp; to ſatisfie their ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honor: raking together liuings, couetouſly &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: not caring who feede the flocke, ſo they may come by the fleece. Moreouer, the doore hath bene opened al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to let into the Church, a rowte and ſwarme of ſuch as are more like the prieſts of Ieroboam then miniſters of the Goſpell, not onely vnlearned Idols, which haue mouthes and ſpeake not, which being weary of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations and couet to liue eaſily, &amp; to that end are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but alſo riotous dicers, gamſters, quaffers, quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, adulterers and ſuch like. If the matter were ſecret, I ſhould do amiſſe to make it manifeſt, but when as it is open in the ſight &amp; view of all men, who can complaine iuſtly, when it is ſpoken of? The Lord put into the hart of our gouernours to redreſſe it. The ſame Lord heape his graces vpon your Lordſhip, with increaſe of honor in his world, and euerlaſting life in the world to come Amen.</p>

I confeſſe with the authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrues.<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> That there are things hard to bee vnderſtood, becauſe we be dull of hearing. Alſo the iuſt iudgement of God vpon the wickedneſſe of men, as it is ſet forth by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 5.</note> in hardning their harts &amp; blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their eyes, that in hearing, they may heare and not vnderſtand, in ſéeing they may ſee, and not perceiue, and alſo in cauſing the word of God to be vnto them as a ſealed booke,<note place="margin">ſa. 29 I.</note> doth make the Scriptures hard to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Now although they be hard alſo in ſome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173409:10"/> ſort euen to the godly and diligent man, &amp; thoſe whom God doth teach, yet they are not hard as you make them, that is to ſay, that in no wiſe they may be vnderſtood or haue any certainty in them, but by the interpretation of the Pope and his cleargie. For that is moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to take away the light from the moſt pure and cleare word of God. This therefore is but diuelliſh craft, by which ye would driue vs from Gods word, which ſtandeth ſure on our ſide, and maketh flat againſt you.

                  <hi>That which you do alleadge out of Saint Peter doth make for vs, where he ſaith, That the vnlearned and vnſtable do peruert not only thoſe hard things, but alſo all other Scriptures to their diſtruction.<note place="margin">2.

Then I reaſon thus, the vnlearned do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the ſcriptures, therefore they are not to deale with them: no priuate perſon is to interprete the Scriptures: therefore none but the Church, or thoſe which haue the authority in the Church: and becauſe the Church is the pillar of truth: whoſoeuer doth ſeparate himſelfe from the Church, doth depart from the truth. And by this we do ſtill proue that you are all heretickes and ſciſmatikes, and do peruert the ſcriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you take them not as the Church doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173409:10"/> them. The ſcriptures ſeeme to be on your ſide, but they are not, they ſeeme to be againſt vs, but they are not.</hi>

               <p>This is very ſound ſtuffe, you make three ſtrong concluſions out of three ſentences of the ſcriptures. In the firſt ye reaſon thus, the vnlearned do peruert the ſcriptures, therefore none can vnderſtand the ſcriptures but the learned: by this, your meaning is to ſhut out all the layitie as you call them from iudging of doctrine, and to allow vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures to none but the learned, that is, the Clergie of Rome, for that we ſhal haue by and by. But ye ouerſhoote your ſelfe much when ye thinke that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by vnlearned men, doth meane ſuch as haue not bin brought vp in ſchoole learning, and ſo put that difference betweene cleargie and layitie: No he counteth all thoſe learned which are taught of God, both of the common ſort of people and other: &amp; all thoſe are vnlearned which are not taught of God: although otherwiſe they abound in all knowledge of tongues and arts, or whatſoeuer. Such as haue learned Chriſt Ieſus, and him crucified, and ſo are become new creatures in Chriſt, they are learned:<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> For in him are all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge. He that hath not learned Chriſt, he is vnlearned. If he be not new borne, but as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſin he hath not ſéene him nor knowne him: although otherwiſe he be neuer ſo ſtudied a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:173409:11"/> in the ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> For this cauſe we ſee that the poore Publicanes are called the children of wiſedome, becauſe they imbraced the doctrine of Chriſt, when the great Doctors the Scribes and Phariſies, were ſtarke blind. They ſayd, none followed Chriſt but the multitude, which knew not the law,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> which were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: when as indeede they were blind and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed themſelues: &amp; ſo fareth it now with the Pope and his ſhauelings: they ſay the people cannot vnderſtand the ſcriptures, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do not. The next ſentence vppon which you conclude is out of Peter alſo, where hee ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No ſcripture is of priuate interpretation. From hence you fetch an inuincible argument to proue that none of vs may interprete, but Rome onely: No priuate man is to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the ſcriptures, becauſe no ſcripture is of priuate interpretation: all thoſe which are not of the Popiſh Cleargie, or which haue not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church from the Pope, or do not expound as the Church, are priuate men: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of thoſe are to interprete the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Here the Pope like a greedy cormorant will haue all to himſelfe. But ye deale deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or at the leaſt vnſkilfully with the text which ye alleadge: for Saint Peter when he ſaith priuate, doth not ſpeake it to make this difference betweene men, as though for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the ſcriptures, ſome ſhold haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp; ſome ſhould be priuate: but he ſetteth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173409:11"/> men againſt God, calling that priuate which is of man. For he doth reaſon thus: the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not giuen by the will of man, but by the ſpirite of God: therefore the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof muſt bee of God, &amp; men muſt not bring that which is their owne. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be by the ſpirit, then is it not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate: if it be out of mans braine, although it ſhould be the Pope &amp; al his Cardinals, yea, ten thouſand Popes, it is ſtill priuate, after the ſenſe in which S. Peter doth call priuate. For let any ſkilful man in the greeke tongue looke vpon the word, which is <hi>idias epiluſeos,</hi> and he will confeſſe, that it doth ſignifie, that which is ones owne. Then the ſenſe is plaine, and it is alſo manifeſt how peeuiſhly you peruert the word of God. What manner of argument is this? a man may not in the interpreting of the Scriptures bring that which is his owne: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none may interprete them but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome. Your laſt reaſon is not worth anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for although it is moſt true, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is the pillar of truth, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe are voyd of truth, which abide not in the Church: yet this is as falſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pope &amp; his company are the Church of Chriſt, as the other is true, and therefore we are no heretikes nor Schiſmatikes for depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from you, which are a den of theeues, which haue conſpired againſt the truth.</p>

                  <hi>Two groſſe things and ſtrange I gather out of your words, the one, that you would haue the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173409:12"/> people of themſelues, to iudge of doctrine: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ye will haue no other interpreter of the ſenſe of the Scriptures, but the Spirit. I pray ye, I am an vnlearned man, &amp; would faine know which is the truth, I heare you alleadge the ſcriptures in one ſenſe, and you ſay you haue the ſpirit, our men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge them in another ſenſe, and ſay they haue the ſpirit: the Anabaptiſts, they haue the ſpirite, the Arrians they interprete by the ſpirit: what ſhal I do? here is euery man hath the ſpirit, &amp; yet euery one goeth a contrary way. It is manifeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that heere needeth a more certaine thing to leane vnto, or elſe the ſimple man cannot tell which way to turne him. What ſhall he do now, but looke how the Church beleeueth, and reſt in that. For he muſt haue that which may teach him to know which of all theſe hath the true ſpirit, or elſe he is neuer the neerer.</hi>

               <p>Ye find two groſſe things in my words, one of them is, that I ſay the people can iudge of doctrine, when it is preached. What doth our Sauior Chriſt meane when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> My ſheep heare my voyce, a ſtranger they wil not heare. they flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrangers? Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they know the voice of the true ſhepheard from the falſe, &amp; can they not diſcerne doctrine? The other is, that I will haue none other interpreter of the ſenſe of the ſcriptures but the ſpirit.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: the eare hath not heard, nor the eye hath not ſeene, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came into mans hart, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things which God hath prepared for them that loue him: but God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173409:12"/> hath reuealed them vnto vs by his ſpirite: for the ſpirite ſearcheth all things, yea the deepe things of God. And the great doubt which you put forth in the ſimple man, which would faine vnderſtand the truth, and which of all thoſe foure that ye named haue the ſpirit, I anſwer, that if he himſelfe haue not the ſpirite of God to teach him, he ſhall not be able to iudge: but if the ſpirite do teach him, then can he find it, for the ſpirite which doth teach the one to vtter the doctrine, which is his, doth teach the other to know that doctrine, and in them conſenteth vnto it, being his owne: and therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith to all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>What a trimme colour you ſet vppon the matter, and how pretily ye can ſhift: but I wil lay open your ſubtiltie. To proue that the velearned people can iudge of doctrine preached, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſaying of Chriſt, My ſheepe heare my voyce &amp;c. I pray ye Sir, if a man ſhould demand of you, whether he meaneth that this ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly or not, and whether, when he ſaith they ſhalbe all taught of God, doth he exclude the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of men or not? I know ye will ſay the voyce of the great Shepeard is heard when thoſe which he hath appointed to be ſhepheards do vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his doctrine. Ye will alſo ſay, that although
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173409:13"/> God teach, yet he doth it by the miniſtery of men. Then I anſwer, that the vnlearned people are to heare the voyce of Chriſt from the Pope, who is their great ſhepheard vnder Chriſt, &amp; God doth teach them by him: they are to ſticke and cleaue to his determination: of themſelues they cannot iudge, but they muſt doe it by him: he muſt tell them which is the woolfe, and which is the falſe Prophet: they cannot tell which commeth with the true ſpirit, or which ſpirit is of God, but as he doth direct them. And for this cauſe we ſay ſtill, that ye haue not the true Catholike faith, nor the ſcriptures on your ſide, nor the true ſenſe, becauſe ye are gone from the only true expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of them.</hi>

But I pray ye Sir, how doth this hang together, the voyce of the true ſhepheard is heard when it is vttered by men, therefore the way to know it is by men. God teacheth by men, therfore God teacheth to diſcerne the ſpirits by men: or if it be ſo, muſt this needs follow, that the Pope &amp; his Cleargy are thoſe men which muſt do the déed? This is a ſtrange thing, Chriſt Ieſus, S. <hi>Paule, S. Peter S. Iohn</hi> &amp; others, do foretell the people of falſe prophets the only way and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to auoyde them, as you ſay, is to hang v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Pope, &amp; yet none of all theſe or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath ſo much as once noted it, or tell the poore people by whoſe direction they might be

Reade Ieremias the Prophet, ye ſhall find the falſe Prophets againſt him, and the Prieſts alſo: and euen as you ſay againſt Luther, and other which imbrace the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they be heretikes, the Pope cannot erre: ſo ſay they for themſelues againſt Ieremias,<note place="margin">Iere. 18.</note> come let vs imagine ſome deuiſe againſt him: for the law ſhall not periſh from the Prieſt, nor the counſell from the wiſe, nor the word from the Prophete. Were the godly people now which forſooke the Prieſts,<note place="margin">Iere. 1.</note> Princes, and Prophets, and gaue eare to Ieremias, apoſtats? Did not the Lord tell him at the firſt when he ſent him, that he ſhould haue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Prieſts and Princes againſt him? Alſo ye may ſee it very fully and plainely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">Iere. 20.</note> that Paſhur the Prieſt, which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, chiefe in the houſe of God, did ſmite Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias, and put him in the ſtockes, when hee heard him propheſie: here was a right Pope, &amp; a ſtoute Biſhop: that durſt ſet Gods Prophet in the ſtockes. This thing is ſet foorth in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173409:18"/> places of the Prophets, how the Prieſts &amp; the falſe Prophetes were linked together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true meſſengers of the Lord. For ye may ſee how the Prieſts and Prophets, and people lay hold on Ieremias,<note place="margin">Iere. 26.</note> and would haue put him to death: for the Prieſts &amp; Prophets accuſed Ieremias before the Princes, that hee was worthy of death.<note place="margin">Eze. 22.</note> The Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> alſo complaineth grieuouſly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſtes and the Prophets. Alſo long before the time of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remias &amp; Ezechiel, the Lord complayned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prieſtes and Prophetes for their wickedneſſe. For thus he ſaith by <hi>Mica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mica 3.</note> the Princes iudge for bribes, the Prieſts teach for reward, and the Prophets do propheſie for money.

                  <hi>Ye take great paines to ſmall profit, for a man may in a word ouerthrow all that you haue built: ye haue ſhewed how the Prieſtes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in the Temple did corrupt their wayes and ioyned with the falſe Prophetes againſt the true meſſengers of the Lord. You gather out of this, that there was no rule left in the Church for the people to trie the worſhip and ſeruice of God by, but this concluſion of yours doth not follow, becauſe the corruption of maners and withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true Prophets, did not hinder but that they remayned ſtill the Church, and the worſhip appointed in the Temple was not to be deſpiſed, for if any did forſake it, they were indeed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were euen at the worſt, Chriſt ſendeth ſuch as he had cleanſed of the leproſie to ſhew themſelues to the Prieſt, and to offer the gift which Moſes had commanded.

Here therefore, I ſay ſtill ye be heretikes and apoſtats, inſomuch as ye haue departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy mother the Church:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:173409:19"/> ye haue forſaken the fellowſhip of the faithfull: &amp; that which ye pretend the abuſes of the Church, is no excuſe at all: for will ye forſake your mother, becauſe ſhe wanteth perfect beauty, or becauſe there is ſome deformity in her? the abuſes are to be reformed, the thing muſt not be deſtroyed. I would wiſh ye therfore to returne, and to ſubmit your ſelues againe, and not to caſt away your ſoules, for ye be all damned heretickes which be out of the Church.</hi>

               <p>The breath of your mouth is very ſtrong, when as with one blaſt ye are able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow whatſoeuer a man can bring out of the word of God. But ye deceiue your ſelfe greatly, for Gods truth will ſtand when you ſhall fall. Your poore and ſilly ſhifts wil ſtand ye in no ſteed: you make your reaſon after this maner, when the Prieſts were moſt corrupt, either in maners or withſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet they remayned ſtill the Church, and the ſeruice and worſhip in the Temple, was not to be deſpiſed: if any did, they were apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats. This ye confirme by ſuch as Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing cleanſed he ſendeth to offer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts, &amp; then by a perpetual rule which Chriſt gaue, <hi>dic eccleſiae</hi> tel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude again y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be heretikes, becauſe we haue forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Rome, where ye tel vs that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuſes ſhold not driue vs to do ſo, we muſt not forſake our mother, for ſome deformity, and want of beauty: I wil anſwer ye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this argument may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:173409:20"/> eaſily be denied, when you ſay thoſe which did forſake the worſhip in the Temple were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats, therefore thoſe which forſake the Church of Rome are heretickes and Apoſtats: for to make this hold, you muſt firſt proue that God hath tied his religion now to Rome, as he had then to the Temple, and that he hath choſen Rome, as he then choſe mount Sion: which ye ſhall neuer be able to do, becauſe it is moſt falſe. And then ye muſt proue, that your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which you maintaine, is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which God hath commanded, and then doubtleſſe hee that ſhall depart from that, is an heretike. For if any did depart from worſhipping in the Temple, hee was not an apoſtat for departing from wicked Prieſts, but for refuſing that which God had appointed him to do. We depart not but from a den of theeues, and from an heape of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble errors, and not from that which God hath commanded: &amp; ſo Chriſt ſendeth the Leapers which he had clenſed, to fulfill the law of God commanded by Moſes, which was to be done, &amp; to be done no where but in the Temple where the Prieſts bare the ſway. The other reaſon which ye bring, as a perpetuall rule of Chriſt, <hi>dic eccleſiae,</hi> tell the Church, is of no value, for although the rule be perpetual, doth it therfore follow, that it can alwayes bee put in practiſe? Hath Chriſt by that rule, where he ſaith if thy brother offend againſt thee, reproue him, if that do not ſerue, take one or two with thee, if he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:173409:20"/> will not heare them, tell the Church, &amp;c. ſet downe that there ſhall be euer a true and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, which will correct the offenders? How ſay ye to the Church of Iſrael in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayes of the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 19.</note> when he complained to God, that they had killed his Prophets, digged downe his Altars, and that he only was left, &amp; they ſought his life: God made him anſwere, that he had a Church among them: I haue left vnto me ſeuen thouſand in Iſrael, &amp;c. which <hi>Elias</hi> did not ſée. Where was <hi>Dic eccleſiae</hi> now become?

Did he euer come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to be abſolued? When your diuelliſh ſinagogue do excommunicate vs, we be the nigher vnto Chriſt. It is true which ye ſay, that the true Church muſt not be forſaken for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine abuſes, but if the abuſes be ſuch as vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy the faith, as yours are, then is it no longer the Church of Chriſt: but a company of wicked hell hounds: and therefore ye do but looſe your labour when you exhort vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurne to your Church, which is no mother of ours, but ſhe is the whore of Babylon, which hath filled the earth with her fornications.

Moreouer, all your matter is not worth a ſtraw which ye haue brought out of the Church of the Iewes: ye haue ſhewed that in Iſrael Elias could ſee no Church: that in the Temple, the Prieſts and falſe Prophets did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt the true meſſengers of the Lord. This were ſomewhat if you could ſhew it in our Church, vnto which Chriſt hath made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, neuer to forſake it: but to giue it his ſpirite to the worlds ende: Your matter is too weake to ouerthrow ſo great and manifeſt truth.</hi>

               <p>It is indeed a certaine and ſure thing, that heretikes will lie, and therefore you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, whoſe Religion is a very hotch potch, &amp; dunghill of all groſſe hereſies, will not ſticke at that. But here is a great reaſon brought, to proue that the holy Saints of God are on your ſide and not on ours. The holy Fathers are like (as all men may iudge) to be on their ſide, which ſucceede them, which do moſt loue them, honour them, and commend them, but therein who knoweth not that ye go beyond vs, which ye accuſe to deface their honor? And therefore they be on your ſide, and muſt néedes take you to be their ſpeciall friends. Indeede we confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you do giue that honour to the Saints which we deny them, and therefore ye ſeeme to loue them more then we. But when the matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the due triall, euery man ſhall eaſily perceiue, that it doth not therefore follow, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173409:23"/> they be on your ſide: becauſe it is no true loue nor right honor which ye giue vnto them: nor ſuch indeed as they can in any wiſe accept of: for when as all their delight and ioy was that God alone ſhould be worſhipped, and haue all his whole honor reſerued to himſelfe: how can they take it well at your hands, when ye play the arrant théeues, and moſt villanouſly robbe God to giue vnto them? Are there any good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare in earth which would bee content to ſee theeues ſpoyle other mens goods, and to bring the ſame to them? if not, how ſhould the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, the holy Apoſtles, &amp; other Saints of God count thoſe ſacrilegious wretches to be their friends, which rob and ſpoyle God of his honor, and thruſt Chriſt from his office, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon them? No, thoſe honor them which follow their ſteps, in giuing all honor to God, they loued and held the truth, which was dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to them then their liues, and therefore are on their ſide which walke in the truth. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your loue and honour which you giue and beſtow vpon them, is euen ſuch as the wicked Apoſtates among the Iewes did beſtow vpon the holy Prophets of God. Thus Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: Woe be vnto you Scribes &amp; Phariſies,<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> ye Hypocrites, becauſe you build the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Prophets, &amp; garniſh the Tombes of the righteous: and ye ſay, if we had bene in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not haue bene partakers with them in the bloud of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173409:24"/> Prophets. Will you ſay that theſe did loue the Prophets, which did ſo much hate Chriſt? did they honour the Prophets, and diſhonour Chriſt? Euen ſuch are you, ye honor the holy Saints of old, but if they were aliue on earth, ye would murder them. In the next place you make that to be nothing which I alleadge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes ye require that I ſhould ſhew ſome ſuch thing in your Church.

Is there ſuch a working, &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the creatures that they may thereby be knowne? Is there ſuch certaintie to trie the trée and to know it by the fruite? And hath the ſpirit which made them, and preſerueth them, ſo loſt his power, and are his qualities and operations ſo weake, that he cannot bée diſcerned from the ſpirit of the diuell?

I ſaid that I did ſpare ye, and it ſhall appeare now, for I will touch ye a little neerer, and yet but with the trueth: not with all that I might ſay nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for it were infinite to rehearſe all your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable waies which ye walke in, and are to bee charged withal. A little ſhall ſuffice: I ſay by your wicked and carnall doctrine, euen your new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ye teach all looſenes, and licentious libertie to the fleſh. As for example, ye denie the merits of good workes, ye teach that men are iuſtified by faith, without good deeds: ye teach Election, and Predeſtination, and denie freewill: and ſo by this meanes, the people are brought to haue no care of good workes but to liue as they luſt: for thus it doth follow, if we be iuſtified by faith alone, what neede we care for good workes? If we bee choſen and predeſtinate, and haue no freewill left in vs, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173409:30"/> chuſe or refuſe, then let God alone, wee cannot further nor hinder our ſelues, what ſhould wee eare, let vs then ſet cocke a hoope, and take our pleaſure while we be here: this is your ſweet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, thus ye teach.</hi>

They bée concluſions of your owne framing, which neither wee teach, neither doe they follow of that doctrine which wée deliuer. The diuell and the fleſh reaſon thus: God hath choſen men, they haue no power of themſelues, they cannot deſerue or merite by their good déedes, but are iuſtified by faith alone in the merits of Chriſt, therefore let them care for no well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but walke after the carnall deſires and luſts of the fleſh: what ſhould they care, they can neither further nor hinder themſelues? But the holy ſpirit of God concludeth thus: God choſe vs when wée were his enemies, of his owne good will, when wée were not able ſo much as to thinke a good thought: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are bound to yéeld all praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto him. He hath of his infinite loue giuen vs his deare and onely be gotten ſonne, for to redéeme vs, and to iuſtifie vs: therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173409:30"/> we ought to ſhew our ſelues louing and kinde vnto him againe, to ſerue, honour, and obey him, in all true obedience, and holy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

They bee worſe then bruite beaſts which haue not learned this out of the word, that God hath choſen his people, hath by his frée grace redéemed and iuſtified them, to the end they may be holy, &amp; zealous of good workes: although not to merit withall, which they cannot, yet to glorifie GOD, as Chriſt ſaith: Let your light ſo ſhine before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Matth. 5,</note> that they may ſée your good workes, &amp; glorifie your father which is in heauen. Likewiſe hée ſaith: Herein is my father glorified,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.</note> that yée grow and bring forth much fruite. We teach with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.</note> he that worketh righteouſneſſe is borne of God, he that committeth ſinne is of the diuell. We teach with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> that hée that committeth ſin, is the ſeruant of ſin. We teach with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that thoſe which are in Chriſt walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. We teach with S. <hi>Iames,</hi>

For it is not becauſe our doctrine doth allow, much leſſe bréede ſuch euils, that they bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, but becauſe our doctrine which is the holy word of God, is of the moſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and not knowne. The Lord by ſundry of his prophets doth complaine of the Iewes, and accuſeth them to bée worſe then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: was therefore the law and doctrine which he had giuen them, to bée blamed? No, they refuſed to walke in his ordinances, and ſo doe the people at this day.

How ſmall ſoeuer the number of ſuch ſéeme vnto your bleared eyes for to bée, they are the true Church of GOD, and moe in number farre, then you could wiſh. I know if all ſhould be guiltie which are accuſed, then your ſaying were true: but when it is moſt euident that the more godly a man is the more he is ſubiect to falſe accuſations and ſlanders: euen as our Sauiour himſelfe was, and his Apoſtles, and other moſt godly which ſuccéeded them: your reaſon is very weake, when ye ſay all are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: for, doth it by and by follow, that all are guiltie?</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that our Church if ye vnderſtand the whole aſſemblie, is full of all wicked vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but ſhall Gods word be blamed for that? There are a number among vs which are of your broode, whoſe euill life is ſéene well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173409:36"/> there are a very great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of méere worldlings, which doe not greatly eſtéeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religion, although they ſeeme now becauſe of lawes, to allow and fauour our ſide, yet in their hearts they rather cleaue vnto you: which is euident by this, that they can better away with the friendſhip and familiaritie of a ranke Papiſt, then of a zealous godly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: they will highly commend the one, and deepely condemne the other.

For can ſuch ſharpe penance, as to faſt three daies together with bread and water: or to go bare footed to our Ladie of Walſingame: or for a man to whip himſelfe vntill the blood follow: or to giue ten ſhillings for a pardon, make men loue ſinne the better? This geare I trow would ſcarre them, and make them to haue little luſt to ſinne. Oh no good ſir, this is nothing ſo ſharpe as hell fire: men finde ſuch a ſwéete taſte in ſinne, that if they may eſcape ſo they will not care. The adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath ſuch pleaſure in his vncleane luſt, that he will to it againe, if he may be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be but a whipping matter.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173409:38"/> will haue one fling at his enemie, if a payre of old angels will diſpatch the matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his pardon at the hands of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and ſo in each ſinne. O yée holy hell-hounds, here is your ſharpe diſcipline, by which ye giue liberty vnto men to turne back to vncleannes, euen as a dogge to his vomite. But while wee reproue your diſcipline, wée haue none our ſelues: and ſo we doe but play the Sophiſters, which would take vpon them to proue that the crow is white. Sir, before I come to our diſcipline, I ſay our doctrine is this, that vnder paine of Gods curſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation, men muſt returne from their wicked waies, and not returne vnto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: they muſt giue vp themſelues wholly to ſerue God in all good workes. As for the diſcipline of our Church, thus ſharp it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the obſtinate ſinner is to be cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, &amp; to be deliuered vp vnto ſatan &amp; not to he receiued in again, vntil ſuch time as he hath declared very apparant tokens of déepe ſorow &amp; harty repentance.

The right faſt which the Scripture doth commend is in eſtimation among vs: we doe not onely write and ſpeake of it, but alſo haue and are ready for to practiſe it, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately. That which you brag of is not the true faſt: for although a man cram his bellie neuer ſo full of fiſh, ſo that hée ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleſh, you call it a faſt. Swéet wines and daintie iunkets are allowed in your faſt.

Your faſting is ſuch as God did reproue in the Iewes, by his prophets: and ſuch as the blind
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173409:40"/> Phariſie boaſted of, ſaying:<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> I faſt twiſe in the weeke. Doubtles if the abſtaining from meate could make a man holy, the Phariſies ſhould haue béen excéeding holy men, and the ancient Iewes againſt whom the Lord complained, ſhould haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended: but they like hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites faſted from bodily ſuſtenance, and filled themſelues with all ſpiritual wickednes: euen ſuch are you, O ye deteſtable hypocrites, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ye goe ſometimes with emptie bellies, yet your ſoules are as full of ſin as euer they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hold. We haue iuſt cauſe to cry out againſt ye for ſeducing ſo many of our forefathers, and making them beléeue that the very broad way to hell, was the norrow &amp; ſtraight way which leadeth vnto heauen. You blind Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, anſwere, is that the ſtraight way vnto life, which the ſtarkeſt hypocrite of all, &amp; the moſt vngodly men can obſerue and walke in as well as other? Is that the narrow gate, which the couetous, the malicious, the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vniuſt man, can paſſe in at as well as other? Tell me this, can there not be a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous heart, and a malicious minde in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die couered with ſackcloth? Cannot a wicked hypocrite puniſh his body, pine and whip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet his ſinfull ſoule within neuer a whit reformed? This then is not the ſtraight way, but the ſtraight way is that which Chriſt and his Apoſtles doe teach, which none can finde nor walke in, but the true faithfull
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:173409:41"/> man: namely, to denie himſelfe, to kil and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie all ſinfull luſts and concupiſcences in the heart: to ſéeke out the will of God, and in all things to obey it. This is the narrow way which all thoſe are to ſéeke after if they will be ſaued: all our godly forefathers haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in this way, and ſought thus to pleaſe God: they knew that the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not bee purchaſed by any ſuch outward trifles as you deuiſed: but that ſuch as will enter in there muſt bée new borne. No man therefore néede to feare when he walketh in this ſtraight way which we publiſh by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell: becauſe he doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our forefathers, vnleſſe it be ſuch as haue forſaken the trueth, being ſeduced by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>

Matth. 15.</note> Doth not the Lord alſo ſay: In vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men? Well, to goe forward, theſe deuiſes of yours are marueilouſly well liked, and the people of the world, are made very deuoute towards God by them: indéede the people of the world doe like well ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and it carrieth them to a kinde of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; to eſtéeme ſuch matters to haue great wiſedome in them. Therefore the Apoſtle doth ſay, that thoſe inuentions of men haue a ſhew of wiſedome: and the people vſe to ſay,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173409:43"/> I warrant ye our fathers which deuiſed theſe things, were wiſe men. But marke well the cauſes which the Lord doth ſet downe, why theſe things ſéeme to haue ſuch wiſedome, and why they be ſo well liked of. The firſt cauſe is, that it is a voluntary religion: a religion which being framed by the corrupt will and braine of men, is very well pleaſing to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſers: and doth alſo fit other men, whoſe wil and braine is as corrupt as theirs. For as that which procéedeth from the will of God, is contrary to the wiſedome of fleſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſliked and condemned of folly: ſo that which commeth out of mans will, is agréeable to man: and therefore approued and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the onely wiſedome. Thus may we ſée (when the Apoſtle ſaith, ſuch things haue a ſhew of wiſedome in voluntary religion) how it commeth to paſſe, that the worſhip which is ſet by the policie and inuention of men, is better accepted of, then that which procéedeth from the will of God.</p>

There are many Scriptures indéede which make for our purpoſe, without any wreſting at all. Euen as this one place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which we be in hande with, néedeth no wreſting to make it ſpeake againſt you, when as euery blind man which cannot ſée, may yet by groping, féele the waight of it againſt ye. But let your foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh words paſſe which deſerue no anſwere, and come again to the matter The next cauſe why ſuch draugh as yours, being but the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and doltiſh dreames of men, hath ſuch a ſhew of wiſedome: and that is the humblenes of minde which appeareth in ſuch holy hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites as worſhip God after their own fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. They doe ſo abaſe themſelues, and are as méeke and lowly as can be. What can a man deuiſe to be more hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble then a deuout Papiſt? he will doe any thing: he is content to bowe downe and to licke vp the duſt at the féete of a ſtock or a ſtone: he doth ſo abaſe himſelfe that he is content to worſhip rotten bones: yea whatſoeuer the holy father of Rome will lay vpon him, he is readie to beare, his minde is ſo humble. But this is not humilitie, O ye blind aſſes, but pride and haughtineſſe of ſpirit euen againſt God, againſt whom ye preſume, and take vpon ye to bee wiſer then he, becauſe ye refuſe the worſhip which he hath preſcribed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173409:44"/> and think ye can frame a better of your owne. This is the humilitie of you Papiſts, in thoſe good intents, and deuotion which ye bragge ſo much of: ye are like ſturdie Rogues, whom a man would take by their patched cloakes to be gentle and lowly: when as indéede they be excéeding proude and rebellious againſt all good lawes. The third &amp; laſt reaſon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe, why there is ſuch a ſhew of wiſedome in corrupt religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is in this clauſe when he ſaith, Not ſparing the bodie: for look how men which are proude men are moued with a ſhew of humilitie: ſo alſo, although they walke after the fleſh, and the fleſh raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in them: yet they like of mortification, after a ſort, a ſhew whereof doth appeare in the outward puniſhing of the fleſh, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are able to attaine vnto, they take it to goe for good payment: and when they haue pined themſelues with hunger for a while; whipped themſelues, or gone barefooted, and barelegged, they ſuppoſe they haue mortified the fleſh. Alas poore wretches, how humble they bée not to ſpare their bodies, to take ſuch paines to ſerue GOD, and yet neuer the better. For when their ſkinne is torne, their heart is whole within ſtill, and as full of all vncleanneſſe as it was before. Theſe are the things which ye boaſt of, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſaith: They be of no price,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.</note> becauſe they pertaine but to the filling of the fleſh. The Diuell hath
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173409:45"/> bewitched men after this ſort, to leade them from the ſight of the true mortification of the fleſh, through the ſpirit vnto outward things of no value. Thus we may vnderſtand, that all your goodly ſhew which yee make, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth: all your religion is but ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they do but loſe their labour which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in it, and are ſo farre off from pleaſing God, that he doth accurſe and abhorre their doings.</p>

Nay, becauſe it cannot haue your allowance to be good: for the holy word of God is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, (which is our whole religion) that all the poyſon which ſuch venemous beaſts as you are able for to vomite vp, is not of force to infect it. But I doe ye wrong, for you ſhew a great reaſon why it cannot be good. Well, I will anſwere it. The reaſon which ye vſe here againſt vs, is that bolt which ye haue taught euery foole to ſhoote: but a very courſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour will defend a man from it: it giueth but a bumpe, and neuer doth pearce, but rebound backe againe. Neuertheleſſe, becauſe among you it is eſtéemed as a ſharpe arrow, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall weapon, I will take ſomewhat the more paines, not onely to view it my ſelfe, but alſo to let others ſée the power thereof. Trueth it is, that whatſoeuer is of God, or whatſoeuer is good, cannot bring foorth that which is euill: no more then darkneſſe can bring foorth light, or heate can cauſe colde: for how can any thing bréede that which is of a quite contrary nature to it ſelfe. But ſay you, Whereſoeuer your Goſpell commeth, there follow ſundrie ſects and hereſies: one main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth this, and another that, with ſundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions. Therfore your Goſpell is not of God, it is not the trueth. Before ye make this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſtrong and ſure, ye muſt proue, that as all ſorts of errors do ſpring where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173409:46"/> is preached, which is ſo indéede, that in like maner the Goſpell is the cauſe of them and doth bréede them, which ye ſhall neuer be able to doe. For as Chriſt and his Goſpell bring peace, and yet he ſaith he came not to ſend peace,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> but a ſword, and to ſet the father againſt the ſonne, and the mother againſt the daughter: and there ſhall be fiue in one houſe, two againſt thrée, and thrée againſt two: euen ſo the Goſpell is the trueth, and ſetteth forth the doctrine of vnitie, and yet whereſoeuer it commeth all kinde of errors ſpring vp. Now euery wiſe man will confeſſe that Chriſt is the author of peace, and the ſtrife that ariſeth betwéene men is not to be imputed to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but to the diuell, and his ſeruants which warre and fight againſt vs, becauſe they hate it, and ſéeke to baniſh it. The ſame diuell is the cauſe of hereſies, for to diſcredite the word of God: whereſoeuer it is taught he ſetteth vp his ſchoole alſo, and will haue his ſchollers goe vnder the name of the Goſpell. For this is one of the readieſt waies that can be to bring the word of God into contempt, and to make men afraide of it. Sée, ſay they, how many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies theſe men fall into, which meddle with the Scriptures: were it not much better that there were no ſuch preaching?</p>

               <p>If ye can gather that we allow of the diuell and his miniſters, ye may alſo affirme that we allow of theſe, for we aſcribe all theſe to them. They bée no companions of our Goſpell, vnleſſe yée take it in this ſenſe, that they alway accompanie the ſame, as vtter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to ouerthrow and deſtroy it. The holie Scriptures doe teſtifie,<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173409:47"/> becauſe ye ſée the ſame ſucceſſe now which it had of old, and how the diuell doth ſweate to quench and ouerthrow it. Tell me this O ye hounds of hell: did the Goſpell hatch or bréed the abominable errors of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Saturninus, Carpocrates, Baſilides,</hi> and ſuch like? Did the Goſpell bring foorth the diueliſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Arrius, Manicheus,</hi> &amp; of others which ſprang vp with it? If ye ſhame to ſay it did: why then ſhould ye not now be as much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to charge it with the errors of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Libertines, and the Family of Loue, and other, which are the warriors of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell as well as you, to fight againſt the truth? As for this that ye ſay, You did all agrée, and were of one minde: It is very true in this, to reſiſt God and his Goſpell, but otherwiſe it is falſe: for ye haue a multitude of ſects and ſundrie orders amongſt ye, which could not one away with the other. Your whole church of Rome is but a ſchiſme, and an Apoſtaſie from the Goſpell, and Church of God: and yet among your ſelues deuided into a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſects and ſchiſmes. For as among the Corinths, I hold of <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith one, I hold of <hi>Apollo,</hi>

It is a very dangerous thing for vnlearned men to meddle with or to reade the ſcriptures: they bee darke, and hard to be vnderſtood, euery man can not gather the true ſenſe of them.

We are but fooles, and not able to diſcerne with what wiſedome ſuch things are done. Surely wee can no ſkill of that wiſedome, when men take vpon them to be wiſer then GOD. But let vs ſee the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and good meaning in this thing. This it is, the common people will abuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and gather errors out of them, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a dangerous caſe for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: the Scriptures are darke, they bee not able to gather the ſenſe. I know this is a great déepe point of wiſedome, among thoſe which ſauour the things of men,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> and not the things of God. But trie it and it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be extreme follie, and thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173409:50"/> thereof are very doltiſh aſſes: although for worldly wit they haue déepe heads, and excell a number of other men. For looke how a cunning artificer, when he ſteppeth out of his owne ſhop, and medleth with a ſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his reach, is no body: euen ſo the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world when it will be ſo buſie, as to controule the wiſedome of God, diſgraceth her ſelfe. God is here checked for giuing ſuch a word, it is better to remoue it away: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, errors, doe ſpring by it. It is hard to bée vnderſtood: God might haue dealth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. O ye blaſphemous wretches: what will ye charge God and his holie word withall: hath he in ſuch wiſe declared his bleſſed will to men, that it were better they were without it? Haue the ſacred Scriptures ſo little profit in them, that they bee better vnknowne then knowne? Moreouer ſee how ye reaſon: men doe abuſe the Scriptures, and gather errors of them, therefore they are to bee remoued. This reaſon is the like, men abuſe meate and drinke, and become drunkards and gluttons: therefore it were good to make a law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre them thoſe things. The bodie cannot liue without meate and drinke: the ſoule can not be ſaued without the word. Some doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe meate and drinke, ſhall therefore all bée debarred? Some doe peruert the worde to their deſtruction, ſhall all other therefore bee depriued, and want the moſt neceſſarie vſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173409:50"/> thereof? No, this is but a craft which yée vſe to make men afraid to ſearch the Scriptures, leaſt they ſhould eſpie you: for there euerie man may eaſily learne to iudge of your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.

For ſo ſoone as men haue a litle knowledge of God, their zeale towards you is quenched: when they ſee once the true treaſure, they will no more of your traſh.

He that wil beléeue, muſt know what and how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue: &amp; therefore of neceſſity, that he haue the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. This doth proue how fooliſh you are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye aſke if it be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to beléeue in Chriſt, &amp; to liue vprightly? as no wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth doubt but that this is enough: ſo there is no foole almoſt, but a man may make him ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this can in no wiſe be without the knowledge of the word. Is it not the word which conuerteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule? Is it not the word which lightneth the eyes, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wiſedome to the ſimple?

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173409:54"/> Is not the man pronounced bleſſed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.</note> which doth meditate in the law of the Lord day and night? O yee miſerable wretches, what whores faces haue you put on, that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſpeake directly contrary vnto God. Is it not aboue their reach to beléeue and to obey God? and yet is it aboue their reach to know what to beléeue, and what is the will and pleaſure of God, which they are to obey? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Can ſubiects obey their Prince and not know the lawes? Or, doe Princes make lawes, and then kéepe them ſecret? If not, wherefore ſhould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of the king of kings be ſecrets? Can any ſeruant doe the will of his maſter, and not know what it is? But you haue an other ſtout argument to proue that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are aboue the reach of the vnlearned, and therefore he is not to meddle with them? he can neuer come to any certaintie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by them: for let ſome man of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning come and reaſon with him, and he may make ſundry reaſons which the other cannot anſwere: which you take to be a plaine proofe that his knowledge is not certaine, but ſuch as he may be driuen from. Alas what ſtuffe here is to reaſon withall againſt the trueth: ſuch a cauiller as you may méete with ſome ſimple plaine man riding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horſe, which he doth perfectly know to be his owne, and make ſuch Sophiſticall reaſons to proue the horſe not to be his, or not to be an horſe, but a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173409:54"/> dog, that the ſimple man cannot anſwere: yet neuertheleſſe, becauſe he is ſure it is a horſe, and his owne, &amp; not a dog, the other may make many reaſons which he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not how to auoide: notwithſtanding, they cannot once bring him in doubt, or to goe from that which he knoweth. Euen ſo al the ſubtil cauillations of the diuel and his miniſters, when they come againſt the faith and knowledge of a godlie ſimple man, which is grounded in the word of God, cannot once moue him: the déepe fetches and ſubtilties may make him muſe, but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth certainly know the trueth, he doth not giue ouer that: he hath felt the power of the word of God in himſelfe, and therfore is out of doubt: it hath done that in him which cannot be wrought but by GOD. Vnſtable ſoules may be beguiled: for they haue not felt the power of godlines. Yée would haue mée proue that God commaundeth the vnlearned men to ſtudie and exerciſe themſelues in the Scriptures: I am aſhamed to heare ye doubt of that matter.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173409:59"/> as euer Chriſt and his Goſpell appeare, they bend all their might againſt it, ſeeking all meanes to quench the light thereof: and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to baniſh it. From hence doe ſpring all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores and tumults in the Church. We affirme indéede that this is a proofe that it is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, that the wicked world cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it: if it were of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, the world would loue his owne: but becauſe it is not of the world, therefore the prince of the world with all the power and armies that hee can make, doth riſe vp againſt it: for Satan will not bee diſpoſſeſſed of his hold without great ſtur. The ſtrong man armed which kéepeth his houſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> muſt firſt be bound before his houſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

But ſo long as all thoſe do remaine, wherefore ſhould the Goſpell loſe any glorie? becauſe theſe things follow it: nay, why ſhuld it not bee ſo much the more glorious, that it doth breake through all theſe things, and by it Chriſt doth rule in the midſt of his enemies? When the Prophet foretolde, that the ſtone which the builders refuſed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> was become the head of the corner: he addeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> this is the Lords doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. So this is the Lords doing, and it is moſt maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173409:60"/> in our eyes, that ſo many cruell perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe follow the Goſpell, and yet cannot baniſh it: ſo many heapes, or rather floods of monſtrous errors do euen as it were flow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it, to couer it, to corrupt it, to aboliſh it: and yet doth ſtill breake forth, as bright and pure as before. So ſoone as Chriſt was borne, perſecution aroſe, and the children were cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthered. <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles do not ſo ſoone go foorth to preach,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> but the falſe prophets are at their héeles. Ceaſe therfore ye wicked wretches, to blaſpheme Chriſt and his Goſpell, becauſe ſuch things follow: they bée not the fruits of the Goſpell, nor they doe not ſpring out of it, but they be the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which do alwaies purſue it.

This may ſeeme ſtrange, but I tell yée it is no marueile, for yée are all blinde as béetles. The Scribes, the Phariſies, the Sadduces, and all the learned among the Iewes did reade Moſes &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtudied them deuoutly: looked for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173409:61"/> the Meſſias which was promiſed and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed there: and yet when he came, they were ſo farre off from knowing him, that they did kill him, and fulfilled the voyces of the Prophets: euen ſo fareth it with you, ye reade what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one Antichriſt ſhould be, and what he ſhould doe, and yet ye are ſo blinde, that ye ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it, in helping him to murther the Saints. The Iewes could not know Chriſt, becauſe they looked for a trim Chriſt, and he came baſe and poore.

You ſay your Church hath alwaies ſtoode ſtedfaſt and vnmoueable, and therefore hath not made the departing. It is true, if wee reſpect place, and ſucceſſion of Biſhops: but what doth that help ye, when ye are departed from the faith, which thing ye might and haue done without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your place and roomes? The high prieſts,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173409:62"/> Scribes and Phariſies among the Iewes had their ſucceſſion and place longer then you, and yet Chriſt and his Apoſtles did depart from them, and were neither heretikes nor ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.

This cannot bee vnderſtood of the materiall temple in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, for that was vtterly deſtroyed ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt. But it is meant of the true temple of God, which is his Church.

                  <hi>The Pope doth take no Lordſhip ouer the conſcience, nor doth not binde them further then he hath authoritie giuen him. The lawes which he maketh are made by the holy Ghoſt which is in him, and therefore there is but one lawgiuer. For ye may euen as well ſay, Moſes gaue lawes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is more then one lawgiuer: for looke how he gaue lawes ſo doth the Pope. Hereby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may ſee that ye reaſon very ſtrongly, when by making lawes yee would proue an equalitie with God, then all the Apoſtles and Prophets were equall with God. And ſo I may ſay for the reſt.</hi>

               <p>God neuer gaue any ſuch authoritie to any man: If the Pope had it giuen him, it was by the Dragon, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Reuel. 13.</note> which gaue him his ſeate, and great authoritie. Ye ſay I reaſon ſtrongly, when I ſay, the Pope doth make lawes, to binde mens conſciences, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope maketh himſelfe God: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maketh that there is more then one law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer. For ſay you, by this reaſon Moſes,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:173409:67"/> all the Apoſtles and Prophets ſhould be equall with God: becauſe they gaue lawes. But as they did it by the holy Ghoſt, ſo doth the Pope: and ſo God is ſtill the onely law-giuer. Thus ye would bleare the eyes of the ignorant, to make them beléeue that the Pope doth make lawes as <hi>Moſes</hi> did. But I will ſhew a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue no lawes nor any of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but ſuch as they receiued from GOD. They neuer challenged authoritie for to make any law contrary to any part of the word of God: nor to abrogate any of the lawes of God. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Galath. 1.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he or an Angell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſhould preach any other Goſpell then that he had preached, let him be accurſed. Such was the authoritie of Gods worde, that if either <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other which brought it, ſhould alter, adde to it, or diminiſh the ſame, he ſhould be accurſed. And yet the Pope doth take power to make lawes contrary to the lawes of the word of God: to diſpenſe with the ſame, to diſanull what hee will: and which is moſt blaſphemous of all, to affirme that the holie Scriptures haue no authoritie without him: but are of themſelues dead &amp; can haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. Is not this to make himſelfe God, or equall with God? What is there which hath authoritie ouer Gods word, but God? Who doth not here eſpie the very hornes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell péep vp, and ſpeake theſe things out of the mouth of his vicar Antichriſt? They do al for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

But I ſay the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome doth not ſo, for he hath the holie Ghoſt and cannot erre.

               <p>What ſhould I ſtand to anſwere bare words: wee know the Pope is not led by the holy Ghoſt, but by the lying ſpirit of the diuel, becauſe he hath ſo flatly troden downe Gods word, and brought in his owne lawes in ſtead of it. I will not ſtand to recite particulars, all the world may iudge. And whereas ye ſay, he doth not forgiue ſins, but as we doe take vpon vs: that is but a ſhift which ye haue deuiſed: for all that will may ſee, whether this bee all one: to pronounce remiſſion of ſins to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, which we do: and to ſend forth pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whereby for ten ſhilling matter, a man might not onely haue forgiuenes of his ſins paſt, but libertie for a good time after to commit many ſinnes.

But when by the Church wee vnderſtand all thoſe companies which do profeſſe Chriſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, thoſe may be ſeduced and fall from the truth, being but the outward &amp; viſible Church: and theſe are here by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> called the world: which thing is manifeſtly to be proued thus: thoſe nations &amp; people where the beaſt ſhould reigne, or which follow the beaſt, are called the world: now it is manifeſt that the beaſt, being the ſame Antichriſt which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth forth, ſhould reigne in the Church: for he muſt ſit in the Temple of God.

               <p>True it is, when ye ſay, your forgeries and lies which are out of all number, were to kéepe the people in awe, and to terrifie them, &amp; ſo hold them in a fooliſh blind deuotion. This ye did when your kingdome ſtoode, let anie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent papiſt in the world denie the dunghill of groſſe lies in the legend and feſtiuall, &amp; ſome other bookes of yours. Very childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may laugh to heare them: if I ſhould reckon them, or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to reckon them, I néede no other penance inioyned me. But of thouſands a few, as theſe: when the diuell came to tempt S. Dunſton, he held the diuell by the noſe with a hot paire of tongs, &amp; cauſed him to rore &amp; crie out: it ſéemeth it was ſome yong diuel, which had a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der noſe. A rich man which neuer had done good déed in his life, but only in anger did throw a loafe at a poore mans head, when he died the diuell came for his ſoule becauſe he had done neuer a good déede: on the other ſide our Lady ſhe claymed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:173409:79"/> the ſoule, becauſe he had giuen a loafe to a poore man: the diuel he replied, that it was no good déed, becauſe he did it not of deuotion, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he muſt haue béen ſaued. In fine, the matter was ſo hard to iudge whoſe he was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was ſent againe into the body. He was not admitted to to goe to heauen nor to hell, nor yet to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. But it ſéemeth our Lady was ſomwhat too haſtie, for being no better man, ſhe ſhould firſt haue let him bin well fried in Purgatorie, &amp; ſo peraduenture ſhe would but that the diuell was ſo greedy that he would not tarrie. She did not wiſely neither, for what a number of ſoules might ſhe loſe, caught by other diuels whiles ſhe was pleading for this. S. <hi>Katherine</hi> did vowe her ſelfe to bee married to none but Chriſt, and therefore the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the holy Hermite <hi>Adrian,</hi> &amp; ſent him to bring Quéen <hi>Katherine</hi> to a place where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhould be ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nized: which was a goodly gorgious Abbey erected for that vſe: where a multitude of glorious virgins did méet the new bride, &amp; bring her in, where ſhe was maried to Chriſt, in the preſence of the bleſſed Lady, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſalute as Quéene of heauen, Lady of the world, &amp; Empreſſe of hell, ſhe biddeth her new daughter welcome, ſhe caried her into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quier to Chriſt, who tooke her by the hand, &amp; ſo was maried vnto her, &amp; put a ring vpon her finger, &amp; did charge her to kéepe it in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance. There was ſuch a glory at that mariage as neuer the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:173409:80"/> like: the bleſſed Virgin alſo ſo glad of her new daughter; and Chriſt of his new wife, muſt néedes cauſe excéeding ioy. Our bleſſed Lady came often among ye in thoſe dayes: and now ſhe doth ſcarce viſite ye once in ſeuen yeares. What ſhould be the cauſe, is ſhe wearied, or hath ſhe conceiued ſome diſpleaſure againſt ye? I pray ye tell me.</p>

               <p>If I play becauſe I recite ſome part of your diuinity: how did your good ghoſtly men play which deuiſed them. Yea how did your Antichriſtian Synagogue play in ſetting them forth to be read openly to the people, and that in the Church. Your blind ſhiftes cannot ſerue the turne. Your vaine ſpéech is not worth the anſwering. Ye ſhall pardon me, if I procéede a little further in the declaration of your holy lyes. Ye haue a goodly hiſtorie (if the booke of lyes be true) of Saint Kenelme once king ouer ſome part of England: wherein you haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:173409:80"/> a faire myracle. The ſtory is very long, and therefore I muſt tell but the ſumme of it. King Kenelme had one ſiſter which was a wicked woman, &amp; hated him, conſpired his death, with Aſheberd his gouernour: who going abroad with the king, which being heauie and layd downe to ſléepe, the traytour made a pit &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to kill him: but he awoke and tolde him he did labour in vaine: God would not haue him killed there. He gaue him a ſmall rod, and told him, that where he ſhould ſet it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, there he ſhould be martyred. Then this tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth together with him vnto a Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne, and there he pight the rod, &amp; forth with it bare leaues and grew vp, &amp; ſuddenly waxed a great Aſh trée, which doth ſtand there vnto this day, &amp; is called Kenelmes Aſh. He ſmote off his head there, and buried his body in a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley betwéene two high hils. Then Quendred his wicked ſiſter was glad, and was Quéene. Now although the body did lie in vnhallowed buriall, yet no man durſt take it vp, for feare of Quendred the Quéene. But a poore widow had a white cow which was euery day driuen into the wood of Cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where ſhe would depart from the reſt of the kine, and goe into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and there did reſt all the day ſitting by the corps, and at night returned home, neuer eate meate, and yet was fatter and gaue more milk then any of the kine. This thing did continue certaine yeres. Afterward as the Pope was at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173409:81"/> Maſſe in Rome, there came a white Doue, and let fall a ſcroll vpon the Altar, in which was written thus in letters of golde: In Clent, in Cowbage, Kenelme king borne, lieth vnder a thorne, his head off ſhorne. The Pope and all his could not tell the meaning thereof, vntill an Engliſh man did expound it. The Pope did ſend to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body ſhould be taken vp. They came to the place which they knew by the white cow: they digged vp the body, and in the place there did ſpring vp a well, which is called Kenelms well vnto this day: where many of the people haue béen healed. When they had vp the body, it was brought to the Abbey of Winchcomb. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way they were ſo drie that they fainted: The Abbot of Winchcombe pitched his croſſe downe, &amp; there ſprang vp a well. Before they came at the Abbey all the bels did ring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mans hand. Quendred demanded where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bels did ring, it was told her that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of her brother was taken vp, and that the bels did ring alone. That is euen as true ſayd ſhe, as both mine eyes are falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my head vpon this booke. And by and by both her eyes fell vpon her Pſalter, vpon which ſhe was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and it is ſéene to this day where they fell vpon the booke. This is all as true, as any lye in the world may be.</p>

               <p>It might bee true as well as the reſt of all your lying wonders, which yee coyned to ſeduce the blinde people into Idolatry. Ye had gotten this aduantage to perſwade that the Pope could not lye nor erre. And therefore whatſoeuer ye did inuent, although it were neuer ſo groſſe, it would be credited: not onely when they prayed to an Image to make them beléeue that it did ſweate in taking paynes to pray for them, and rowle the eyes: but alſo all your fained wonders, of which I will yet giue a little further taſte. For although they may ſéeme vnprofitable to bee vttered, yet becauſe they declare your ſpirit of lying, whereby An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is knowne: there is vſe in them. What a goodly ſtorie is there of your Saint Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike? When he was at Rome, hee ſawe in a night Ieſu Chriſt in the ayre, holding thrée ſpeares, &amp; brandiſhing them againſt the world: and his mother ran haſtely againſt him, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what he would doe. He ſayd, all the world is full of vices, and therefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them with theſe ſpeares. Then ſhée fell downe at his féete and ſayd: Deare ſonne haue pitie, &amp; tarie thy iuſtice by thy mercie. He ſayd, Thou ſéeſt what iniuries they doe me. She ſaid, Son temper thy wrath &amp; tarie a little: I haue a ſeruant a noble fighter againſt vices, he ſhal run ouer al &amp; vanquiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thée. And I ſhal giue vnto him another ſeruant to help, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhal fight as he doth. And our Lord ſaid, I am
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:173409:82"/> appeaſed. But I would ſée who they be. Then ſhe ſhewed him S. Dominike, and S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and he praiſed them. Here the bleſſed Lady did helpe at a pinch, or elſe all had bin marred. Theſe her two Apoſtles which ſhée did ſende forth, euen the two Friers, Saint Dominike and S. Francis, were woorth all the twelue Apoſtles of Chriſt. There were certaine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies heard S. Dominike preach, which had bin ſeduced by heretikes: which knéeled down at his féete, and told him their caſe, prayed him to helpe them. He had them tarry a little, and they ſhould ſee what Lord they had ſerued. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non they ſaw ſpring out of the middle of them a cat right foule and horrible, which was big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a great dog: which had great flaming eyes, a broad tongue, and bloody, ſhe had a ſhort tayle, out of which iſſued a terrible ſtink. She turned her about among the Ladies a while, and afterward mounted vp by the bell rope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtéeple, and went away, leauing a foule ſtinke behind her. Thus were theſe good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies deliuered by holy S. Dominike. After S. Dominike was dead he healed many, &amp; rayſed vp ſundry from death. The bleſſed Virgin S. Mary might doe the Pope now a great good turne, to giue him two ſuch as Dominike and Francis: and it may be if he beg hard and call lowde enough, ſhe will heare him.</p>

And therefore is called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda Aurea,</hi> that is to ſay, Golden Legends. The feſtiuall, which was read vpon Saints daies in the church, doth fetch as many autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities out of the Legend, as out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I perceiue you are loth to heare any further: &amp; therefore I will tell the leſſe. What ſay ye to that good Lady which was ſo deuout in the ſeruice of the bleſſed Virgin: and yet at a time vpon the purification her Prieſt was from home, ſo that ſhe could not haue Maſſe. Neuertheleſſe ſhe went into her Chappel and praied to the bleſſed Virgin, ſo long vntill ſhée fell on ſléepe. At the laſt ſhe ſaw a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of goodly Virgins, and one glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin aboue the reſt. She ſaw alſo one come in with a bundle of candles. She ſaw a prieſt goe to Maſſe with two Deacons, which were <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>Vincent:</hi> The prieſt was Chriſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one had a candle giuen them light, and ſo had ſhe: two yong Angels began the introite of the Maſſe: the Angels bare the Tapers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the prieſt all the virgins did ſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe. When the offering came, euery one brought their candle, and they ſtayed for this woman
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:173409:83"/> which did not come with hers, the great Ladie ſent to her two times, and yet ſhe would not come. She ſent the third time to pray her to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her candle, or elſe to take it from her. She would not: then the meſſenger laid hold of the candle, he pulled and ſhe pulled ſo long, that the candle was betwéene them pulled in péeces, he had one end, and ſhe another, and withall ſhée did awake and found the péece of candle in her hand. Then ſhée did know certainly ſhée had heard Maſſe, and thanked God and our bleſſed Lady. Surely they did her wrong, for they ſhould haue awaked her firſt, and then haue bid her offer her candle. If I had béen as this Lady, I would haue made much of that péece of candle. For it is like that ſome Chaunler in heauen made it. For Chriſt &amp; the Angels oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie candles, whenſoeuer they ſay Maſſe. If I ſhould tell all the tales of holy S. <hi>Anthonie,</hi> which fought with a number of diuels: of good S. <hi>Patrike,</hi> which in Ireland did finde out Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: of pitifull S. <hi>Francis:</hi> of chaſt Saint <hi>Hagnes,</hi> which yet was ſo gentle to be wooed, that at diuers times ſhe would holde forth her finger to receiue a ring. Indéede I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſhe did receiue any but of prieſts: by which it doth appeare ſhe loued them well. If (I ſay) I ſhould tell all of theſe and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber moe, I cannot tell whether you Papiſts might be iudged the greater liers for deuiſing, or I the greater foole for rehearſing. To bée

For ye haue none other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the authoritie of the Church to allow theſe things. Gods word doth curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne periuries and murders committed by ſuch treacheries. To diſpute out of that for the maintenance of them, yee know yee ſhall haue but a cold ſuite of it. It is a great deale better therefore to lay the word of God aſide, and to ſet forth what power the new God hath for to change the nature of things. He is of another maner power then men wéete. The GOD which hath ſpoken in the Scriptures, can doe nothing nor ſay nothing but trueth: but the God of Rome hath power to do what he will, and to ſay what hee liſt, whether it bee true or falſe. This is a mightie God, he can play both faſt and looſe at his pleaſure. Let a thing bée neuer ſo much commended by God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173409:85"/> if he ſay it is naught, then is it naught. So on the other ſide, whatſoeuer it bee that is condemned to be euill, he hath power to make it good. This is the cauſe why you ſay many are deceiued, they looke but to the Scriptures, and forget this God, which hath power ouer the Scriptures.</p>

I ſee it is good for a man to take heed with whom he doth talke. I could anſwere ye to the full, if it might doe good. Thus much I will ſay, that it is one thing to commit treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a prince which is godly: and another thing, to kill an heretike which is no lawfull prince. The ſubiects indeede may not diſobey and rebell: but when the prince is no right prince, then they are no longer ſubiects. What ſay ye to Ehud in the booke of the Iudges? did not he ſlay Eglon king of Moab, and that vnder colour of a meſſage?

               <p>I will maintaine that which I haue ſaid, and ſhew that they doe not make for that which ye cite them for. It is ſet forth in the Iudges, that Iſrael had done euill in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the Lord, and he made Eglon king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites to preuaile againſt them, &amp; to bring them into ſeruitude. When the children of Iſrael cried vnto the Lord, he raiſed vnto them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer, euen Ehud. Afterward it is ſet foorth how he came, went with a preſent to Eglon, deſiring to ſpeake with him alone, and ſo ſlew him. Conſider well in this ſtorie, firſt, how Eglon was an vniuſt vſurper,<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.</note> oppreſſing Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael like a cruell tyrant where he had no right.

The word in Moſes is <hi>Tſelem,</hi> after which Adam was created: Gen. <hi>1.</hi> Now looke where hee ſpeaketh to the children of Iſrael by Moſes, to command them to break down the idols of the heathen, and ye ſhall finde the ſame word.

In the <hi>2.</hi> booke of Kings, chap. <hi>11.</hi> it is ſaid, They went into the houſe of Baal, and brake downe his images, which he calleth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame name.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:173409:90"/> By this it doth appeare, that in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there is no ſuch difference betwéene idol and image, as the Papiſts would beare men in hand.

I require no more, for it is manifeſt that the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:173409:91"/> Scripture doth forbid all images of God, as in Deuterono. <hi>4.</hi> there is forbidden not onely <hi>Semel,</hi> but alſo <hi>Temnuah</hi> and <hi>Tabnith.</hi> And in Eſay <hi>40. <hi>Demuth.</hi>

               <p>I ſée no cauſe why I may not eſtéeme you to be obſtinatly blinded. Becauſe in theſe places which I haue cited, he doth not onely ſpeake of the true GOD, but alſo the reaſons which are ſet downe to forbid the images, doe diſproue not onely the worſhipping, but alſo the very making. For why doth Moſes tell them, ye heard the voyce of words, when God ſpake, but yee ſaw no ſimilitude? Why doth Eſay ſet forth the incomprehenſible greatnes of the Lord: but to conclude as he doth, that there can no ſimilitude be made of God? And therefore this concluſion doth ſtand ſure, that images in the Scripture and idols bee all one. And therefore the Papiſts do but iuggle when they ſhift their hands of idolatrie in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: we doe not worſhip idols, we do but ſerue images. Ours be the images of the true God: and we take them not to bee any more then i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. If this would haue ſerued the turne, the Iſraelites might haue anſwered to Moſes, and Eſay, well enough.</p>

Paul ſaith. Againe,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. Acts 17.</note> the ſame Apoſtle telleth, that the Godhead is not like ſiluer or golde, &amp;c. Againe, God is incorruptible, man is mortall: which reaſon is vſed in the <hi>1.</hi> chap. to the Romanes. Sundry things may bée ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſhew that an image is a teacher of lyes: and therefore accurſed and abominable before God. For it is wicked to lye of a man: but moſt abominable to tranſforme God into an heape of lyes: as when a man ſaith, this is the picture of God: then muſt it be taken to be like God: or els why is it his image more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another thing: theſe lyes then are in it, God is inuiſible, this is ſéene: God is aliue, this is dead: God is incomprehenſible, for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of heauens cannot containe him, this is contained in a ſmall roome: God is almightie, this hath no power: God is glorious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, this is ſubiect to ruſt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yea to conclude, it is nothing but lyes,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173409:92"/> becauſe it doth neither in ſhape, becauſe God is a ſpirit, and that is a groſſe ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, neither in any property ſet forth that which is in God, but the quite contrary. If any ſhould picture your Pope like a dog or a toade, ye would not take it well: and yet hee is liker to either of theſe, then the Lord is to any image: yée doe more diſgrace him when ye picture him like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, then ye can doe to any man to pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture him like a toad.</p>

               <p>To proue that theſe did not worſhip the idols themſelues, nor take them to bee gods: a few reaſons may ſerue. For if it be ſhewed that the heathen did not, then muſt it néedes follow that the Iewes did not: vnleſſe ye will make them which had more knowledge of God, to be more brutiſh then the other. Now for the heathen, S. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> that which might bée knowne of God was manifeſt in them: which he expreſſeth to bee the eternall power &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.

                  <hi>that thoſe were not gods which are made with hands. The learned among the heathen, did thinke as you ſay, but not the multitude.</hi>

               <p>Although the heathen did know that the idols were not the very gods themſelues, yet this perſwaſion of S. Paul was not néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, becauſe they did aſcribe a certaine diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto them: they thought the gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes came downe into them, and did there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue honor. Euen as you papiſts thought of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:173409:93"/> your idols, and therefore you would trudge a great way on pilgrimage. As for the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe which ye make it is falſe: for when Paul and Barnabas came to Lyſtra,<note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> and had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a man that was lame, did not all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude cry out, Gods are come downe vnto vs in the likenes of men? They took Barnabas to be Iupiter, and Paul to be Mercurie. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iupiters prieſt came to haue offered ſacrifice vnto them, as he had done to the idoll. The Iewes therfore which had ſéene the wonders which God wrought in Egypt &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> red ſea, which had heard him ſpeak out of the fire, with ſo great terror: could not bee ſo brutiſh, as to think the Calfe which they ſaw Aaron make, to be the God indéed which had brought them out of Egypt, but the image to repreſent the ſame God, whom they ment to worſhip in it. Where the fooliſh papiſts may ſee that in this foule idolatrie of the Iewes, they neither did worſhip the idoll it ſelf: neither any falſe gods. You doe worſe then they, becauſe ye worſhip the idols of thoſe which are no gods: as of the virgin Mary, and other Saints.</p>

               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt is a very compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudge in this matter: and he vſeth the one word for the other. For where it is ſaid in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Deut. <hi>6.</hi> and alſo <hi>10.</hi> Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and him ſhalt thou ſerue: he doth expreſſe it in Matth. <hi>4.</hi> Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, &amp; him onely ſhalt thou ſerue: I cite it to this end, to ſhew that where Moſes hath ſet downe <hi>tagnabod,</hi> Chriſt doth tranſlate it by the Euangeliſt, <hi>latreuſcis:</hi> which is ſuffcient to ſhew that he put no difference betwéene them. To proue that <hi>dulia</hi> is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to images, we néede goe no further then to the commandement, where he doth forbid
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:173409:94"/> to make them: and then he ſaith, Thou ſhalt not bow to them: neither ſhalt thou ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for he vſeth the verbe <hi>gnabad.</hi> I might alleage ſundrie other places: as Pſalm. <hi>97.</hi> where he ſaith, They ſhall be confounded <hi>gnobede peſel,</hi> which ſerue the grauen image.

If euer there were abominable and foule idolatrie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world, either by Iewes or Pagans, or other, it is among you, ye goe, no doubt, as farre as euer did any. Now a daies the papiſts, at leaſt a number of them, doe waxe more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: they will not with their forefathers alow any thing to the idols themſelues: but al to the things which they repreſent: wheras in times paſt the controuerſie was whether the image was to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip, that the firſt paterne that it did repreſent was? Some of your great clarks did affirme the one way, and ſome the other: for one part defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the images of the Trinitie, and of the Croſſe were to bee worſhipped with <hi>latria,</hi> diuine worſhip: the other part doth reply that <hi>latria</hi> is proper only to God: and therefore not to be giuen to the images: they muſt adore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſome lower worſhip. But ſhift how yée can, agrée or diſagrée among your ſelues, the holy word of God ſtandeth ſtill, condemning and accurſing ye as deteſtable Idolaters. For
